# ComfyUI node to create warped noise from video

# WORK IN PROGRESS

This slightly modifies and wraps the code from @RyannDaGreat: https://github.com/RyannDaGreat/CommonSource/blob/master/noise_warp.py

Including code from their rp -library: https://github.com/RyannDaGreat/rp

And code from: https://github.com/Eyeline-Research/Go-with-the-Flow

## Raft optical flow model is automatically downloaded upon execution.

Currently usable with my CogVideoX -nodes https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-CogVideoXWrapper/

And with experimental AnimateDiff motion lora by spacepxl: https://huggingface.co/spacepxl/animatediffv3_warpednoise_motionlora
